# Experiment with Google AI Studio

## Disclaimer

These days, I have been watching the Tron movies - thanks to a friend who got me to the movie theater to see the recent one. 

It's interesting how the 1982 movie is much more forward thinking in terms of machines and AI. A discussion that was probably forgotten by many but which is interesting in the current AI revolution / bubble :


> **Alan Bradley:**  
> I tell you, ever since he got that Master Control Program, system's got more bugs than a bait store.

(Hi Claude MCP !)

> **Dr. Walter Gibbs:**  
> Gotta expect some static. After all, computers are just machines. They can't think.

> **Alan Bradley:**  
> Some programs will be thinking soon.

> **Dr. Walter Gibbs:**  
> Won't that be grand? Computers and the programs will start thinking and the people will stop.

In any case, I decide to try the vibe coding of a basic tron game with Google AI Studio and this is it. Didn't spend much time, it's more a side side silly project.
