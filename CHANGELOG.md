- Python script for precise model coordinate transformation
- Enhanced visual fidelity with metallic surfaces and detailed textures
- Error boundary and fallback system for 3D model loading failures
- Automatic favicon generation in build process
- Normal mapping with full intensity for surface detail
- Ambient occlusion mapping for realistic shading

### Changed
- Replaced simple box/sphere bike geometry with detailed 3D model

- Resolved MIME type errors caused by changing asset filenames
- Corrected 3D bike model center of gravity to match original LightCycle positioning
- Fixed bike model scaling and ground positioning for consistent gameplay
- Fixed bike model floating above ground - now sits properly at y=0
- Fixed bike model backwards orientation - now faces forward with 180Â° rotation
- Enhanced normal mapping and material lighting response for better visual quality

### Technical
- Integrated Three.js OBJLoader for 3D model support
- Pre-processed 3D model coordinates to match game coordinate system
- Implemented dynamic material color override system
- Added random geometry attributes for derezz shader compatibility
- Simplified build pipeline to copy entire assets/ folder automatically
- Added Suspense and ErrorBoundary for robust 3D model loading
- Enhanced asset management system for future extensibility
- Configured Vite to generate consistent filenames (index.js, index.css) for better deployment reliability
- Created Python tooling for 3D model coordinate transformation and validation

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
