## üîß **Post-Integration Fixes**

### **Model Positioning Issues**
After initial deployment, several critical positioning issues were identified and resolved:

#### **Ground Positioning Fix**
- **Issue**: Model was floating above ground level
- **Root Cause**: Target Y-position was set to match original LightCycle (y=0.25) 
- **Solution**: Updated Python transformation script to place model bottom at y=0 (ground level)
- **Result**: Bike now sits properly on the arena floor

#### **Orientation Correction**
- **Issue**: Model was facing backwards (rear-first movement)
- **Root Cause**: Original model orientation didn't match game's forward direction
- **Solution**: Added 180¬∞ rotation around Y-axis in coordinate transformation
- **Result**: Bike now faces forward during movement

#### **Material Enhancement**
- **Issue**: Normal mapping appeared flat, lacking surface detail
- **Root Cause**: Default normal map intensity and missing material properties
- **Solution**: Enhanced material setup with explicit normal scale and AO intensity
- **Result**: Improved surface detail and realistic lighting response

### **Technical Implementation**
```python
# 180¬∞ rotation around Y-axis applied during coordinate transformation
x_rotated = -x_scaled  # Flip X coordinate
z_rotated = -z_scaled  # Flip Z coordinate  
y_rotated = y_scaled   # Maintain Y coordinate
```
